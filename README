1. WHAT IS nInfo?
=================
    nInfo  is a  suite  of libraries  designed to  retrieve a  great  range  of 
information  of the underlying  operating system,  hardware,  C implementation, 
file system, etc...
    This allows you to  write cross-platform software,  and yet have sufficient
information about the platform being used to make optimizations.

2. COMPONENTS OF nInfo
======================
    nInfo consists of several individual libraries,  each providing information
about one specific component.

  * osinfo: Information about  the operating system,  its version, the version
            of several installed components,  the distributor, standards compa-
            tibility, package management methods, ...
  * hwinfo: Information  about  the type,  brand, and status  of the  hardware,
            methods for reading  from several input devices and writing to out-
            put devices.
  * fsinfo: Information  about the  type and  the capabilities  of the  various
            file systems present on a system.
  * ccinfo: Information about the compiler being used (macros only).
  * libccm: Support library  that provides macros for  defining various contai-
  			ners, such as arrays, vectors, strings and maps.
  			
3. OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT
===========================
    nInfo attempts to support as many operating systems as possible. Currently,
however, only  Windows, Mac OS X and various Linux distributions are supported.
    To compile nInfo  from  source, you'll  need a  C90 compiler and  the CMake 
build  system.  nInfo  strives  to be  as  compatible  with  every  compiler as 
possible, however, it is only tested rigorously on GCC.


4. BUILDING nInfo
=================
    To build nInfo, it is  sufficient to invoke following commands,  assuming a
C compiler and CMake are set up properly:
    
    | cmake .
    | make
    
    To install the nInfo  libraries and  headers, issue the  following command:
    
    | make install
    
5. LICENSING
============
    nInfo is  released under  a zlib/libpng  license. To view the  full license
text, please see the `COPYING' file  in the root of the source directory. For a
full list of all contributors, see the `AUTHORS' file.

6. CONTACT
==========
    nInfo is currently part of the LibSylph project. Please see 
http://libsylph.sourceforge.net/support for info  on contacting the developers.
